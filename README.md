# ColorSmash

ColorSmash is an engaging and colorful game where players match colors as they fall. The game is built using Swift and SpriteKit.

## Description

In ColorSmash, players must match the falling colored circles with the target color displayed at the top of the screen. The game starts off easy but becomes more challenging as the speed of the falling circles increases and the spawn interval decreases. Players must be quick and accurate to achieve high scores and beat their previous records.
